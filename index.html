<h3><a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1st Annual Rocky Mountain Fluid Mechanics Research Symposium</h3>
<center><img src="images/flame.jpg" style="width:700px;"></center>
<p>The Rocky Mountain Fluid Mechanics Research Symposium is a local technical meeting bringing together students, faculty, and professional researchers with a common interest in fluid mechanics. The primary purpose of the symposium is to provide student researchers along the Colorado Front Range and the greater Rocky Mountain Region the opportunity to present and discuss their work in a casual setting. Both oral and poster presentations will be hosted; however, neither is a prerequisite for meeting attendance. Beyond local networking, other professional development opportunities will be offered including a Resume/CV/Research Statement review table hosted by professors and research professionals.</p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h3><a id="program" class="anchor" href="#program" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program</h3>
<center><img src="images/airplane.jpg" style="width:700px;"></center>
<p>The symposium program will consist of a series of consecutive topical sessions in technical areas such as bio-fluids, environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics, turbulence, combustion, and renewable energy. Each topical session will consist of 15 minute oral presentations delivered by undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers. The symposium will take place in the Discovery Learning Center (DLC) at the University of Colorado, Boulder on August 4, 2015 from 8:00am to 5:00pm, with a keynote speaker in the morning and poster sessions during coffee breaks, lunch, and the late afternoon reception.</p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<p>Abstracts are requested for both oral and poster presentations in all areas of fluid mechanics. Oral presentations are each 15 minutes in length, with 12 minutes for the speaker presentation and an additional 3 minutes for questions and discussion. Posters sessions will be held during coffee breaks, lunch, and the afternoon reception. As part of its educational mission, all talks at RMFM 2015 will be delivered by undergraduate, graduate, or postdoctoral researchers.</p>

<p>Abstracts are limited to a 1300 character maximum and should be submitted to <a href="mailto:abstracts@rockymountainfluids.org">abstracts@rockymountainfluids.org</a> by <strong>July 15, 2015</strong>. Abstract submissions must include the following components:
<ul>
<li>Title of abstract submission</li>
<li>Choice of poster or oral presentation</li>
<li>Presenting author name, educational level, and affiliation</li>
<li>Co-author names and affiliations</li>
<li>Abstract text (1300 character maximum)</li>
</ul>
Lead authors and presenters are limited to one submission, accepted authors will be notified by July 20, 2015.</p>
