<p>The Rocky Mountain Fluid Mechanics Research Symposium is a local technical meeting bringing together students, faculty, and professional researchers with a common interest in fluid mechanics. The primary purpose is to provide  student researchers along the Colorado Front Range and the greater Rocky Mountain Region the opportunity to present and discuss their work in a casual setting. Both oral and poster presentations will be hosted; however neither is a prerequisite for meeting attendance. Beyond local networking, other professional development opportunities will be offered including a Resume/CV/Research Statement review table hosted by local professors and research professionals.</p> 

<p>Presentations will take the form of either a 15-minute oral presentation, with an additional 5 minutes for questions and discussion, or a 30-minute poster presentation. For those wishing to present their work a brief abstract is kindly requested. These should include a short title, choice of poster or oral presentation, and a 1300 character maximum description of the work to be presented. Lead authors and presenters are limited to one submission, and should email their abstracts by July 1st 2015 to <a href="mailto:abstracts@rockymountainfluids.org">abstracts@rockymountainfluids.org</a>.
